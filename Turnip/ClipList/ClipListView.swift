/// The triage screen (`docs/UIUX.md` § "Clip List (triage)"): a grid of square tiles
/// — the original video first, then one per detected trick window, then a trailing
/// "+" tile that appends a new clip. Each tile autoplay-loops its window inline
/// (accessibility permitting) so the grid reads like a wall of tiny previews rather
/// than static frames, draws a read-only timeline over the bottom showing where its
/// window sits in the full source video (not adjustable here — that's what the
/// editor is for, and the original tile has none since its window is the whole
/// video), and carries the trash button. Tapping a derived clip's tile opens the
/// full `ClipEditorView` directly — "view large" and "edit" are the same entry
/// point, not a separate icon; the original tile isn't tappable, since editing the
/// source video isn't a thing this screen does.
///
/// "Done" exports and saves every non-trashed derived clip to Photos, deletes the
/// original from Photos if its tile was trashed, and pops back to Home — there is no
/// separate export/confirmation screen.
///
/// An analysis that detected zero tricks still lands here — the original tile and the
/// "+" tile, same as any other triage — rather than on a dead-end screen of its own;
/// `showsNoTricksFound` then puts up a dismissible glass notice over the grid to say so.
///
/// The processing screen pushes this with the pipeline's output. The back chevron
/// pops to Home rather than to the processing screen, Photos-app style — centered
/// inline title on the same line as the chevron. This view deliberately declares no
