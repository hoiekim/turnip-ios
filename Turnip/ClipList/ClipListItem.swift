/// One triage card's data: a detected trick window plus its computed crop rect
/// (docs/DESIGN.md pipeline steps 5-6), with the user's trash decision.
///
/// `isTrashed` defaults to `false`: every clip starts untrashed. It's the original
/// tile's own reversible flag — `ClipListViewModel.save()` reads it to decide
/// whether to delete the source video from Photos — while a derived clip's trash
/// button removes the item outright (`ClipListViewModel.delete(_:)`) instead of
/// setting this, so it never goes `true` on one in practice. `Identifiable` by a
/// stable `id` (not the window times) so view state survives a re-run of detection
/// producing slightly different windows.
///
/// `isSaved` records that this clip's video has already been written to Photos by
/// `ClipListViewModel.save()`. It exists so that a Done retried after a partial
/// failure re-exports only the clips still missing from the library: without it the
/// save loop's predicate matches every clip again and the ones that already landed
/// get written a second time, which nothing in the app can undo. It resets when the
/// editor commits new geometry (`ClipListViewModel.applyEditorResult(_:to:)` builds a
/// fresh item), since an edited clip is no longer the one that was saved.
///
/// `isOriginal` marks the one item — always `ClipListViewModel.items[0]` — that
/// stands for the source video already in Photos rather than a derived clip: it
/// carries the full-video window and full-frame crop, is never opened in the
/// editor, and its trash button is the reversible `isTrashed` toggle above rather
/// than an outright removal.
