///
/// The flow per check: fetch the manifest from
/// `<baseURL>/api/models/current`; if it names a newer version than the staged
/// one, download the bytes, verify their SHA-256 against the manifest, and
/// atomically stage them. The running session never hot-swaps models
/// mid-inference — staging only affects what the next launch loads.
///
/// An actor for two reasons: the check is `async` throughout (network, disk),
/// and `lastError` is written from the check's continuation, so actor
/// isolation keeps the read in tests data-race-free without manual locking.
///
/// The service never throws: every failure is recorded on `lastError` and the
/// previously staged model keeps serving. A failed update must be silent to
/// the user, never a crash or a half-staged model. Cancellation is not a
/// failure: a cancelled check leaves `lastError` nil instead of recording
/// the cancellation as a failed check.
///
/// Inert by default: a `nil` baseURL (no endpoint configured) makes
/// `checkForUpdates` a no-op with zero network traffic, keeping the "nothing
/// leaves the device" promise until a deployment exists.
