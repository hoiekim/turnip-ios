# Turnip privacy compliance notes

The single home for the answers App Store Connect asks for at submission
time, so nobody has to reverse-engineer them later. v1 is the fully
on-device release; anything that changes with v2 (upload, accounts) is
marked as such below.

## App Store "nutrition label" answers (v1)

**Data Not Collected.** The v1 app collects no data, full stop:

- No accounts, no sign-in, no identifiers.
- No analytics. No third-party crash-reporting SDK; crash/hang metrics arrive
  Apple-mediated (Xcode Organizer + MetricKit) under the user's own "Share With App
  Developers" opt-in — not declarable as collected data. See `docs/DESIGN.md`
  decision #7.
- No calls to any Turnip-controlled server in the v1 path. A `URLSession` client
  for OTA model updates does exist — `Turnip/ModelUpdates/ModelUpdateClient.swift`,
  the only networking code in `Turnip/` — and it is inert: it refuses any scheme
  but `https`, it takes its endpoint as a parameter rather than holding one, and
  `ModelUpdateService.checkForUpdates` returns on a `nil` base URL before it
  reaches the client. No app code constructs either type, so nothing supplies
  that URL; the service's only callers are unit tests against a mock, and the
  client's own test exercises the `https` guard without issuing a request.
  Bytes do cross the network when PhotoKit downloads an iCloud-only video
  (`isNetworkAccessAllowed` in `PhotoVideoResolver`/`ThumbnailLoader`) — from
  the user's own iCloud, through a system framework. Videos are read from the
  Photos library the user grants access to, processed on-device by the bundled
  MoveNet model, and exported clips are written back to Photos.
- Nothing is uploaded, shared, or transmitted to any Turnip-controlled server.

## Privacy manifest (`Turnip/Resources/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`)

Declares: no tracking (`NSPrivacyTracking` false, no tracking domains),
no collected data types, and two required-reason API categories —
`NSPrivacyAccessedAPICategoryFileTimestamp` with approved reason `C617.1`
(the orphan sweep in `PhotoVideoResolver` reads `.creationDateKey` on files
inside the app's own `tmp/` container) and
`NSPrivacyAccessedAPICategorySystemBootTime` with approved reason `35F9.1`
(`ProgressReportClock` measures elapsed time between in-app progress reports
via `systemUptime`). See the audit table below.

Required-reason API audit (re-run if these change):

| API category | Used? | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| UserDefaults | No | No `UserDefaults` references in `Turnip/` |
| File timestamps | Yes — C617.1 | `PhotoVideoResolver.deleteOrphanedTemporaryExports` reads `.creationDateKey` via `resourceValues(forKeys:)` on files in the app's own `tmp/` container — in-container metadata reads, declared with approved reason C617.1. (`PHAsset.creationDate` is PhotoKit metadata on user-granted assets, not a file-timestamp API.) |
| System boot time | Yes — 35F9.1 | `ProgressReportClock.shouldReport` (in `ProcessingPipeline.swift`) defaults its clock to `ProcessInfo.processInfo.systemUptime` to measure elapsed time between in-app progress reports — declared with approved reason 35F9.1. |
| Disk space | No | No volume-capacity queries |
| Active keyboards | No | No text fields anywhere in the app |

Third-party SDKs: the only dependency is `TensorFlowLiteSwift`
(`Podfile.lock` resolves its `Privacy` subspec, which carries the pod's
own `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`), and it is not on Apple's list of SDKs that
require a manifest/signature. If a dependency is added, check both.

## Photos access

- Home requests `.readWrite` for the gallery. PhotoKit offers no
  read-only level — the choices are add-only (can't enumerate the
  library) or read/write — and exporting clips back to Photos needs the
  write half anyway, so one honest prompt covers both.
- `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` explains the read side in plain
  language. `NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription` ships alongside it, for
  the export path that writes clips back — reachable from Home through
  Processing and the clip list, so the add-only prompt it declares does
  fire when a user confirms an export.
- `PHPhotoLibraryPreventAutomaticLimitedAccessAlert` is set: with
  limited access the app shows its own "select more" affordance instead
  of iOS re-prompting on its own schedule.

## Temp-file and cache hygiene

- **Composition exports.** Slow-motion/edited videos come back from
  PhotoKit as compositions with no file URL, so `PhotoVideoResolver`
  exports them to `tmp/` (`turnip-composition-export-<uuid>.mov`).
  The owning screen (`VideoLibraryViewModel`, which owns the navigation `path`)
  deletes the export when its `SelectedVideo` leaves the path (back-out or a new
  selection) and also when a resolution is cancelled after the export finished
  but before the push — so browse-and-back-out, the dominant interaction,
  never accumulates files. `TurnipApp` sweeps orphans left by crashed sessions
  at launch. The prefix is what makes both the delete and the sweep recognize
  only our files.
- **Clip exports.** The export-confirmation screen stages each exported clip in
  a fresh `tmp/turnip-export-<uuid>/` scratch directory and hands it to Photos
  through `ClipPhotosSaver` (add-only); the whole directory is deleted when the
  screen goes away (`ExportConfirmationViewModel.tearDown()` waits for the run
  to drain first) — so a staged temp URL is removed after its Photos save
  succeeds *and* after it fails (verified, issue #81). Removal waits for screen
  dismissal rather than happening per clip right after the save, because the
  Share action hands the system the file itself: a saved clip stays shareable
  while its row is on screen, and a clip whose Photos save failed deliberately
  keeps its file — sharing to Messages or AirDrop is the way out of a revoked
  Photos permission. A screen killed before `tearDown()` is swept by the next
  screen (`sweepStaleExportDirectories`); the `turnip-export-` prefix is what
  makes the sweep recognize only our directories.
- **Thumbnails** are in-memory only (`PHCachingImageManager`), in both
  the Home grid and the clip-list work — there is no on-disk thumbnail
  cache. If one ever lands, it belongs in `Caches/`, never `Documents/`,
  so iOS can evict it and it isn't backed up.
- **Logs** go to `os.Logger` only; nothing is written to log files.
- Nothing is written to `Documents/` anywhere in v1.

## Export compliance

`ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption` is `NO`: v1 talks to no Turnip-controlled server,
so TestFlight uploads don't prompt for export-compliance answers. (The only
network is iCloud downloads through PhotoKit, over HTTPS — exempt either way.)
The OTA model-update client now on `main` refuses any scheme but `https`, which
is exempt as well, so the flag stays `NO` once an endpoint is configured.
Revisit only if non-exempt encryption or non-HTTPS networking is introduced.

## Deferred to v2 / later

- Server-side data handling for uploaded clips (retention, deletion
  requests, GDPR/CCPA) — belongs to `turnip-farm`; see `docs/DESIGN.md`
  decision #4 (retention: keep forever, user-deletable).
- Analytics / crash-reporting consent — `docs/DESIGN.md` decision #7:
  none in v1; crash/hang metrics arrive Apple-mediated under the user's
  own opt-in.
